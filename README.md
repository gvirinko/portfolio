This is my project for the React JS course at [ReDi School (Berlin)](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin).
Deployed here: [My Portfolio](https://gvirinko.github.io/).

My Portfolio page currently has the following info: list of my projects, resume to download (in process), current level of front-end skills and latest commits, fetched from GitHub.
Extra features: dark mode using Context API, conditional rendering of skills.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
